                <p>
                  Welcome to Derry, Maine. It’s a small city, a place as hauntingly familiar as your own hometown. Only in Derry the haunting is real.
                  They were seven teenagers when they first stumbled upon the horror. Now they are grown-up men and women who have gone out into the big world to gain success and happiness.
                  But the promise they made twenty-eight years ago calls them reunite in the same place where, as teenagers, they battled an evil creature that preyed on the city’s children. 
                  Now, children are being murdered again and their repressed memories of that terrifying summer return as they prepare to once again battle the monster lurking in Derry’s sewers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Readers of Stephen King know that Derry, Maine, is a place with a deep, dark hold on the author. 
                  It reappears in many of his books, including Bag of Bones, Hearts in Atlantis, and 11/22/63. But it all starts with It.
                </p>

                      WHAT IF you could go back in time and change the course of history?
                      WHAT IF the watershed moment you could change was the JFK assassination? 11.22.63, the date that Kennedy was shot - unless . . .
                  </p>
                  <p>
                      King takes his protagonist Jake Epping, a high school English teacher from Lisbon Falls, Maine, 2011, on a fascinating journey
                      back to 1958 - from a world of mobile phones and iPods to a new world of Elvis and JFK, of Plymouth Fury cars and Lindy Hopping, 
                      of a troubled loner named Lee Harvey Oswald and a beautiful high school librarian named Sadie Dunhill, 
                      who becomes the love of Jake's life - a life that transgresses all the normal rules of time.
                  </p>  
                  <p>
                      With extraordinary imaginative power, King weaves the social,
                      political and popular culture of his baby-boom American generation into a devastating exercise in escalating suspense.

                        Salem's Lot is a small New England town with the usual quota of gossips, drinkers, weirdos and respectable folk.
                        Of course there are tales of strange happenings - but not more than in any other town its size.
                    <p>
                        Ben Mears, a moderately successful writer, returns to the Lot to write a novel based on his early years, 
                        and to exorcise the terrors that have haunted him since childhood. The event he witnessed in the house
                        now rented by a new resident. A newcomer with a strange allure. A man who causes Ben some unease as things
                        start to happen: a child disappears, a dog is brutally killed - nothing unusual, except the list starts to grow.
                        Soon surprise will turn to bewilderment, bewilderment to confusion and finally to terror . . .

                          Florence: Harvard symbologist Robert Langdon awakes in a hospital bed with no recollection
                          of where he is or how he got there. Nor can he explain the origin of the macabre object that is found hidden in his belongings.

                          A threat to his life will propel him and a young doctor, Sienna Brooks, into a breakneck chase across the city.
                          Only Langdon’s knowledge of the hidden passageways and ancient secrets that lie behind its historic facade
                           can save them from the clutches of their unknown pursuers.

                          With only a few lines from Dante’s Inferno to guide them, they must decipher a sequence of codes buried
                          deep within some of the Renaissance’s most celebrated artworks to find the answers to a puzzle which
                          may, or may not, help them save the world from a terrifying threat…

                            Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time was a publishing phenomenon. Translated into thirty languages,
                            it has sold over nine million copies worldwide. It continues to captivate and inspire new readers every year.
                            When it was first published in 1988 the ideas discussed in it were at the cutting edge of what was then known
                            about the universe. In the intervening years there have been extraordinary advances in our understanding
                            of the space and time. The technology for observing the micro- and macro-cosmic world has developed in leaps and bounds.
                            During the same period cosmology and the theoretical sciences have entered a new golden age.
                            Professor Stephen Hawking has been at the heart of this new scientific renaissance. Now, in The Universe in a Nutshell,
                            beautifully illustrated with original artwork commissioned for this project, Stephen Hawking brings us fully up-to-date
                            with the advances in scientific thinking. We are now nearer than we have ever been to a full understanding of the universe.
                            In a fascinating and accessible discussion that ranges from quantum mechanics, to time travel, black holes to uncertainty theory,
                            to the search for science's Holy Grail - the unified field theory (or in layman's terms the 'theory of absolutely everything')
                            Professor Hawking once more takes us to the cutting edge of modern thinking.

                            The God Delusion caused a sensation when it was published in 2006. Within weeks it became the most hotly debated topic,
                            with Dawkins himself branded as either saint or sinner for presenting his hard-hitting, impassioned rebuttal of religion of all types.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            His argument could hardly be more topical. While Europe is becoming increasingly secularized, the rise
                            of religious fundamentalism, whether in the Middle East or Middle America, is dramatically and dangerously
                            dividing opinion around the world. In America, and elsewhere, a vigorous dispute between 'intelligent design'
                            and Darwinism is seriously undermining and restricting the teaching of science. In many countries religious
                            dogma from medieval times still serves to abuse basic human rights such as women's and gay rights. And all from
                            a belief in a God whose existence lacks evidence of any kind.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Dawkins attacks God in all his forms. He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability
                            of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry and abuses children.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The God Delusion is a brilliantly argued, fascinating polemic that will be required reading for anyone interested in this most emotional and important subject.
